# Introduction

Keyaos (氪钥枢) is an **AI API routing gateway** that unifies fragmented API credits across multiple providers into a single, intelligent endpoint.

## What is Keyaos?

Keyaos is **not** a model provider — it doesn't run any AI inference. It is a pure **resource orchestration layer**: receive requests, pick the cheapest available upstream credential, forward the request, and return the result.

## Why Keyaos

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Zero deposit fees** | We absorb all Stripe processing fees — $10 in = 10.00 Credits |
| **Self-use is free** | Route through your own credentials with zero platform fees |
| **Up to 3% service fee** | No single user is ever charged more than 3% per API call |
| **No rate limit** | No per-minute request cap; supports high-concurrency workloads |
| **Token-level billing** | Precise, transparent costs calculated at the token level |
| **Privacy by design** | No content is ever stored — architecturally guaranteed, source-verifiable |

## Core Capabilities

### Unified API Endpoint

Connect once, access all models. Keyaos provides both **OpenAI** and **Anthropic** compatible endpoints:

| Protocol | Endpoint | SDK Support |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| OpenAI | `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI SDK, LangChain, LiteLLM |
| Anthropic | `POST /v1/messages` | Anthropic SDK (with reasoning→thinking) |

### Smart Lowest-Cost Routing

Every request is routed to the cheapest available provider + credential combination. The routing engine:

- Queries real-time pricing from all connected providers
- Compares effective cost across all credential × provider pairs
- Automatically fails over to the next cheapest option on errors
- Ensures zero added latency — billing and health checks are fully async

### Credentials Sharing Marketplace

Got idle API credits sitting unused? Share them on Keyaos and earn platform credits:

- Share credentials from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more
- Set your own price multiplier
- Earn credits whenever your credentials are used
- Withdraw shared credentials at any time
