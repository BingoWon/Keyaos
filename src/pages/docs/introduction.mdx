# Introduction

Keyaos (氪钥枢) is an **AI API routing gateway** that unifies fragmented API credits across multiple providers into a single, intelligent endpoint.

## What is Keyaos?

Keyaos is **not** a model provider — it doesn't run any AI inference. It is a pure **resource orchestration layer**: receive requests, pick the cheapest available upstream credential, forward the request, and return the result.

## Core Capabilities

### Unified API Endpoint

Connect once, access all models. Keyaos provides both **OpenAI** and **Anthropic** compatible endpoints:

| Protocol | Endpoint | SDK Support |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| OpenAI | `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI SDK, LangChain, LiteLLM |
| Anthropic | `POST /v1/messages` | Anthropic SDK (with reasoning→thinking) |

### Smart Lowest-Cost Routing

Every request is routed to the cheapest available provider + credential combination. The routing engine:

- Queries real-time pricing from all connected providers
- Compares effective cost across all credential × provider pairs
- Automatically fails over to the next cheapest option on errors
- Ensures zero added latency — billing and health checks are fully async

### Credentials Sharing Marketplace

Got idle API credits sitting unused? Share them on Keyaos and earn platform credits:

- Share credentials from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more
- Set your own price multiplier
- Earn credits whenever your credentials are used
- Withdraw shared keys at any time

### Zero Deposit Fees

When you top up, **100% of your payment converts to credits**. No surcharges, no hidden fees.
