# Authentication

All API requests require authentication. Keyaos supports two authentication methods to be compatible with both OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs.

## API Keys

Generate your API key from the [API Keys page](/dashboard/api-keys) in your dashboard. Keys use the format:

```
key-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Authentication Methods

### Bearer Token (OpenAI style)

Used by the OpenAI SDK and most third-party libraries:

```
Authorization: Bearer key-xxxxxxxx
```

### API Key Header (Anthropic style)

Used by the Anthropic SDK:

```
x-api-key: key-xxxxxxxx
```

> Both methods work on **all** endpoints. Use whichever your SDK expects.

## SDK Configuration

### OpenAI SDK (Python)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="key-xxxxxxxx",
    base_url="https://your-gateway.workers.dev/v1",
)
```

### OpenAI SDK (Node.js)

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "key-xxxxxxxx",
  baseURL: "https://your-gateway.workers.dev/v1",
});
```

### Anthropic SDK (Python)

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    api_key="key-xxxxxxxx",
    base_url="https://your-gateway.workers.dev",
)
```

### Anthropic SDK (Node.js)

```typescript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: "key-xxxxxxxx",
  baseURL: "https://your-gateway.workers.dev",
});
```

### cURL

```bash
# OpenAI endpoint
curl https://your-gateway.workers.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer key-xxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"openai/gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}]}'

# Anthropic endpoint
curl https://your-gateway.workers.dev/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: key-xxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4","max_tokens":1024,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}]}'
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Never expose keys in client-side code** — always call from your backend
- **Rotate keys regularly** — generate a new key and revoke the old one
- **Use environment variables** — store keys in `.env` files, not in source code
