# Quick Start

Get up and running with Keyaos in under two minutes.

## 1. Get Your API Key

Sign in to your dashboard and generate a key from the [API Keys page](/dashboard/api-keys).

## 2. Choose Your SDK

Keyaos supports both OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs. Pick the one that fits your workflow.

### OpenAI SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="key-xxxxxxxx",
    base_url="https://your-gateway.workers.dev/v1",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is Keyaos?"}],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Anthropic SDK

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    api_key="key-xxxxxxxx",
    base_url="https://your-gateway.workers.dev",
)

message = client.messages.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is Keyaos?"}],
)
print(message.content[0].text)
```
