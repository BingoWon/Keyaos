# Quick Start

Get up and running with Keyaos in under two minutes.

## Base URL

Point your existing OpenAI or Anthropic SDK to your Keyaos gateway:

```
https://your-gateway.workers.dev/v1
```

## Authentication

Use your **API Key** from the [API Keys](/dashboard/api-keys) page:

```
Authorization: Bearer key-xxxxxxxx
```

## cURL Example

```bash
curl https://your-gateway.workers.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-chat",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://your-gateway.workers.dev/v1",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="google/gemini-2.5-flash",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Node.js (OpenAI SDK)

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://your-gateway.workers.dev/v1",
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "google/gemini-2.5-flash",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

## Supported Models

Keyaos routes to the cheapest healthy provider for any given model. Visit the [Models](/dashboard/models) page to see all available models and their real-time pricing.

## BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

Add your own upstream API keys on the [BYOK](/dashboard/byok) page. When a request matches a model supported by your key, it routes directly — **completely free**, with zero platform fees.
