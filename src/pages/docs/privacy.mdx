# Privacy

Keyaos is designed with a strict privacy-by-default architecture. Your data safety is not a feature toggle — it's how the system is built.

## What We Log

For billing and transparency, we record basic **request metadata** only:

- Timestamp
- Model name
- Provider used
- Input / output token counts
- Credit cost or earnings

This metadata is visible on your [Usage](/dashboard/usage) page.

## What We Never Log

**Your prompts and completions are never logged, stored, or visible to us** — even when errors occur. There is no opt-in, no toggle, no exception. The routing engine processes your request payload in memory and forwards it directly to the upstream provider. Nothing is written to disk or database.

This applies equally to:

- Direct API calls
- Self-use (BYOK) routing
- Cross-user routing

## Source-Available Engine

Keyaos is licensed under the [Business Source License (BSL)](https://github.com/BingoWon/Keyaos/blob/main/LICENSE). Every line of the routing engine is published on GitHub:

**[github.com/BingoWon/Keyaos](https://github.com/BingoWon/Keyaos)**

You can inspect, audit, fork, and self-host the entire system. No black boxes.

## Architecture

The routing engine runs on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), processing requests at the edge closest to you. Request payloads are handled in-memory within the Worker's isolate and are never persisted.

The database (Cloudflare D1) stores only:

- User accounts and settings
- Credential metadata (encrypted secrets, quota, health status)
- Billing records (ledger entries, payment history)
- Request metadata (the usage log described above)

## Data Residency

Cloudflare Workers execute globally at the nearest edge location. Cloudflare D1 data is stored in the region configured during deployment.
