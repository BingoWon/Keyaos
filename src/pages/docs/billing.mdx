# Billing

Manage your credits, payments, and auto top-up from the [Billing](/dashboard/billing) page.

## Credits

**Credits** are a prepaid service balance used to pay for API requests on Keyaos. The conversion rate is fixed at **1:1** — no math needed:

| Amount | Credits |
|--------|---------|
| $1.00 USD | 1.00 Credits |
| $10.00 USD | 10.00 Credits |
| $100.00 USD | 100.00 Credits |

## Deposit Fees

**Zero.** We absorb all Stripe payment processing fees. When you buy $10.00, you receive exactly 10.00 Credits. No markup, no hidden costs.

## Payment Methods

We accept a wide range of payment methods through Stripe:

- Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JCB
- UnionPay
- Alipay

Choose from preset amounts ($5 / $10 / $20 / $50) or enter any custom integer amount (minimum $1).

## Auto Top-Up

Never run out of credits mid-workflow. Auto Top-Up automatically recharges your balance when it drops below a threshold you set:

1. **Add a payment method** — Complete at least one manual purchase to save your card with Stripe
2. **Set your threshold** — Choose a balance level that triggers automatic recharge (e.g., $5)
3. **Set your amount** — Choose how much to recharge each time (e.g., $10)
4. **Toggle on** — Enable Auto Top-Up from the [Billing](/dashboard/billing) page

Auto Top-Up pauses automatically if charging fails consecutively, and you'll be notified on the dashboard.

## Payment History

All transactions — manual purchases, auto top-ups, and their statuses — are visible on the [Billing](/dashboard/billing) page.
