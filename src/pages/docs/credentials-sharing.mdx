# Credentials Sharing

Turn your idle API credits into Keyaos platform credits by sharing your upstream credentials.

## How It Works

1. **Add your credential** — Go to the [BYOK page](/dashboard/byok) and add an API key from any supported provider
2. **Set your price** — Configure a `price_multiplier` to control your pricing (e.g., `0.5` = 50% of market price)
3. **Earn credits** — Whenever another user's request is routed through your credential, you earn platform credits
4. **Stay in control** — Disable or remove your credentials at any time

## Supported Providers

You can share credentials from any provider that Keyaos supports:

- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Google (Gemini)
- DeepSeek
- OpenRouter
- And more — check the [BYOK page](/dashboard/byok) for the full list

## Price Multiplier

The `price_multiplier` determines both your earning rate and routing priority:

| Multiplier | Meaning | Priority |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `0.5` | 50% of market price | 🟢 Very high — cheapest gets picked first |
| `1.0` | Market price (default) | 🟡 Normal |
| `1.5` | 150% of market price | 🔴 Low — only used when cheaper options are unavailable |

**Lower multiplier = higher priority = more usage = more earnings** (at a lower rate per request).

## Platform Fee

When your credential serves another user's request, a **6% platform fee** applies:

- **3%** from the consumer side
- **3%** from the provider side (you)

When you use your **own** credentials for your **own** requests (self-use), routing is **completely free** — no platform fee.

## Security

- Your API keys are encrypted at rest
- Keyaos only uses your credential to forward requests to pre-approved upstream endpoints — you cannot set a custom endpoint
- The platform monitors credential health and automatically stops routing to credentials that return auth errors

## Earnings Example

Suppose you share an OpenRouter API key with `price_multiplier = 0.8`:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Model market price | $3.00 / M input tokens |
| Your effective price | $3.00 × 0.8 = **$2.40** |
| Consumer pays | $2.40 |
| Platform fee (6%) | $0.144 |
| You earn | **$2.256** in credits |
