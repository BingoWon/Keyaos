# Credentials Sharing

Turn your idle API credits into Keyaos platform credits by sharing your upstream credentials.

## How It Works

1. **Add your credential** — Go to the [BYOK page](/dashboard/byok) and add a credential (API key, OAuth token, etc.) from any supported provider
2. **Set your price** — Configure a price multiplier to control your pricing strategy
3. **Earn credits** — Whenever another user's request is routed through your credential, you earn platform credits
4. **Stay in control** — Disable or remove your credentials at any time

## Supported Providers

You can share credentials from any provider that Keyaos supports:

- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Google (Gemini)
- DeepSeek
- OpenRouter
- And more — check the [BYOK page](/dashboard/byok) for the full list

## Price Multiplier

The price multiplier determines both your earning rate and routing priority. It must be between 0 and 1:

| Multiplier | Meaning | Priority |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `0.5` | 50% of provider price (default for subscription credentials) | 🟢 Very high — cheapest gets picked first |
| `0.8` | 80% of provider price (default for credit-based credentials) | 🟡 High |
| `1.0` | Provider price (maximum) | 🔴 Normal — only used when cheaper options are unavailable |

**Lower multiplier = higher priority = more usage = more earnings** (at a lower rate per request).

Subscription credentials (e.g., Google API with quota that refreshes periodically) default to `0.5` since the marginal cost to you is near zero. Credit-based credentials (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) default to `0.8` to reflect the real cost of your balance.

## Platform Fee

When your credential serves another user's request, **a 3% service fee** is deducted from your earnings. The consumer also pays a 3% fee on their side. **No user is ever charged more than 3% on any single API call.**

When you use your **own** credentials for your **own** requests (self-use), routing is **completely free** — no fees of any kind.

## Security

- Credentials are stored on Cloudflare's infrastructure with access limited to the routing engine
- Keyaos only forwards requests to pre-approved upstream endpoints — custom endpoints cannot be specified
- The platform monitors credential health and automatically disables credentials that return authentication errors
- Secrets are masked in all API responses and the dashboard UI
- Duplicate credentials are rejected to prevent conflicts

## Earnings Example

Suppose you share an OpenAI credential with `price_multiplier = 0.8`, and a request incurs $5.00 in provider costs:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Provider price | $5.00 |
| After multiplier (0.8×) | $5.00 × 0.8 = **$4.00** |
| 3% service fee | −$0.12 |
| **You earn** | **$3.88** in credits |
