# Pricing

Keyaos passes through upstream provider pricing with no markup on the base model cost. Platform fees apply only to cross-user routing.

## Credits

Keyaos uses an internal currency called **Credits**. The exchange rate is fixed:

| Amount | Credits |
|--------|---------|
| $1.00 USD | 1.00 Credits |
| $10.00 USD | 10.00 Credits |
| $100.00 USD | 100.00 Credits |

## Deposit Fees

**Zero.** We absorb all Stripe payment gateway fees. When you buy $10.00, you receive exactly 10.00 Credits. No markup, no hidden costs.

For comparison, [OpenRouter charges a 5.5% fee](https://openrouter.ai/docs/faq#pricing-and-fees) on credit purchases.

## Routing Fees

Fees depend on how your request is routed:

| Scenario | Fee |
|----------|-----|
| **Self-use** — request matches your own BYOK credential | **0%** (completely free) |
| **Cross-user routing** — request is fulfilled by another user's shared credential | **6%** total (3% consumer + 3% provider) |
| **No match** — no healthy credential available | No charge |

### How Cross-User Fees Work

When a request is routed through another user's shared credential:

- **Consumer pays**: base cost × 1.03 (3% surcharge)
- **Provider earns**: base cost × 0.97 (3% platform commission)
- **Platform keeps**: the 6% spread

### Example

A request costs $0.10 at the upstream provider rate:

| Party | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Consumer charged | $0.103 |
| Provider earns | $0.097 |
| Platform fee | $0.006 |

## BYOK — Bring Your Own Key

Add your own API keys on the [BYOK](/dashboard/byok) page. When a request matches a model your key supports, it routes directly to the upstream provider through your credential — **completely free**, with zero platform fees.

You can also **share** your keys to earn credits when other users route through them. Set a **price multiplier** to control your pricing strategy.

## Price Multiplier

Each shared credential has a configurable price multiplier (default: 0.8×):

| Multiplier | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 1.0× | Cost price (you earn nothing, consumer pays base rate) |
| 0.8× | 20% discount — attracts more routing traffic |
| 0.5× | Subscription keys — aggressive discount |
| 1.5× | Premium pricing — for high-availability keys |
