# Pricing

Keyaos passes through provider pricing with no markup on the base model cost. Platform fees apply only to cross-user routing.

## Routing Fees

Fees depend on how your request is routed:

| Scenario | Your Fee |
|----------|----------|
| **Self-use** — request matches your own BYOK credential | **0%** (completely free) |
| **Cross-user routing** — request is fulfilled by another user's shared credential | **3%** service fee |

**No user is ever charged more than 3% on any single API call.** When you use your own credentials, routing is completely free.

### How Cross-User Fees Work

When a request is routed through another user's shared credential, each party pays a 3% service fee independently:

- **Consumer pays**: base cost × 1.03
- **Provider earns**: base cost × 0.97

### Example

A request costs $5.00 at the provider's rate:

| Party | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Consumer charged | $5.15 |
| Provider earns | $4.85 |

## BYOK — Bring Your Own Key

Add your own API credentials on the [BYOK](/dashboard/byok) page. When a request matches a model your credential supports, it routes directly to the provider — **completely free**, with zero fees.

You can also **share** your credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, and more) to earn credits when other users route through them. See [Credentials Sharing](/docs/credentials-sharing) for details on pricing strategy and multipliers.
