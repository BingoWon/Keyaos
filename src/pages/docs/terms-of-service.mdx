# Terms of Service

Last updated: February 27, 2026

Welcome to Keyaos. These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("you" or "User") and the operators of Keyaos ("Keyaos," "we," "us," or "our") governing your access to and use of the Keyaos platform, including our website, APIs, and all related services (collectively, the "Service").

**By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, together with our [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy), which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service.**

## 1. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years of age to access or use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

## 2. Service Description

Keyaos is an AI API routing gateway. The Service acts as a transparent intermediary layer that receives your API requests, selects an optimal upstream AI model provider based on availability and cost, and forwards the request on your behalf. Keyaos provides endpoints compatible with both the OpenAI and Anthropic API protocols.

**Keyaos does not develop, operate, host, or control any AI models.** All AI model inference is performed entirely by third-party upstream providers. The Service is limited to request routing, credential management, and billing facilitation.

We may modify, update, or discontinue the Service or any part thereof at any time, with or without notice.

## 3. User Accounts

To use the Service, you must register an account. You agree that:

- All registration information you provide is accurate, current, and complete
- You will maintain the security and confidentiality of your account credentials and API keys
- You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account
- You will notify us immediately upon discovering any unauthorized use of your account

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any account at our sole discretion, with or without cause, and with or without notice.

## 4. Billing & Credits

### 4.1 Prepaid Credits

Access to the Service requires the purchase of prepaid credits ("Credits"). The full purchase amount is converted to Credits with no deposit fees.

### 4.2 Non-Refundable

**All Credit purchases are final and non-refundable.** By purchasing Credits, you acknowledge and agree that no refunds will be issued for any reason, including but not limited to unused Credits, account suspension, account termination, or dissatisfaction with the Service.

### 4.3 Platform Fees

When your request is routed through another user's shared credential, a service fee of up to 3% applies. When you use your own credentials for your own requests (self-use), routing is completely free with no platform fee.

### 4.4 Fee Changes

We reserve the right to adjust our fee structure at any time. Material changes to fees will be communicated with at least 30 days advance notice through the Service or via email. Your continued use of the Service after such notice constitutes acceptance of the updated fees.

## 5. Acceptable Use

You agree not to use the Service to:

- Violate any applicable law, regulation, or third-party right
- Transmit content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable
- Generate content that promotes violence, discrimination, harassment, or illegal activities
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other users' accounts, or any connected systems
- Interfere with, disrupt, or place an unreasonable burden on the Service infrastructure
- Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of any proprietary component of the Service
- Use automated tools to scrape, crawl, or extract data from the Service beyond normal API usage
- Resell, sublicense, or redistribute access to the Service without prior written authorization
- Circumvent any rate limits, usage restrictions, or security measures
- Impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity

We reserve the right to investigate any suspected violation and take appropriate action, including suspension or termination of your account, without prior notice.

## 6. Third-Party AI Models & Upstream Providers

### 6.1 No Control Over AI Models

Keyaos does not own, operate, train, or control any of the AI models accessible through the Service. All model inference is performed by independent third-party providers ("Upstream Providers"). Keyaos has no influence over the behavior, quality, accuracy, availability, or output of any AI model.

### 6.2 Your Responsibility

You are solely responsible for reviewing and complying with the terms, conditions, and acceptable use policies of each Upstream Provider and AI model you access through the Service. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the terms of an Upstream Provider, the Upstream Provider's terms shall govern with respect to your use of that provider's models.

### 6.3 No Representations

Keyaos makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or availability of any third-party AI models, their outputs, or the terms and policies of any Upstream Provider. Any information we display about model pricing, capabilities, or provider policies is provided for convenience only and may not be current or accurate.

## 7. Data Handling & Privacy

### 7.1 No Content Storage

Keyaos processes API requests in transit only. **Your prompts, completions, and all request/response payloads are processed in memory and forwarded directly to the Upstream Provider. We do not log, store, retain, or have access to your content at any time.** There is no opt-in or opt-out — this is an architectural guarantee.

### 7.2 Metadata Only

We collect only the minimal request metadata necessary for billing and service operation, including timestamps, model identifiers, token counts, and cost records. This metadata does not include any content from your prompts or completions.

### 7.3 No Training

We do not use any user data, metadata, or any other information to train, fine-tune, or improve any AI model or machine learning system.

### 7.4 Open Source Verification

The Keyaos routing engine is source-available under the [Business Source License](https://github.com/BingoWon/Keyaos/blob/main/LICENSE). You may independently verify our data handling practices by reviewing the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/BingoWon/Keyaos).
